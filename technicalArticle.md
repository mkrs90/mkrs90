# What is Pseudocode and how does it help with programming?

There are very few people who can pick up a paintbrush and paint a master piece without first thinking about what they want to paint.
Even the greats like Michalangelo and Picasso did some sort of rough sketch before painting their master pieces. It's just a simple part of life.
You need to have an idea first before jumping head first into a major project or halfway through you might find out that you're going in the wrong direction
and wasted all that time and paint that will need to just be tossed to the side. 

Coding is a lot like painting. You need to have a plan, a sketch. Know what you want to achieve before the paintbrush even touches the canvas. It doesn't mean things can't change later
but it certainally helps to know at the very least what colors you need to use.
