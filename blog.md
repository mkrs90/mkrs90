### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

First week was honestly nothing like I expected it would be. After years of traditional education style where you listen to a guided lesson to material then try and achieve high grades and memorize every little detail espically with my history degree since it was all about memorization. The way the camp has gone this first week is almost a nice breather from that. You're on your own code learning path guided by both instructors and peers.  

### What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

I'm excited to learn more about javascript. I find it extremely interesting and such a powerful tool. We've only touched on it just a few times within this first week but I'm excited none the less.

Here's a tidbit not a lot of people know - I actually have a degree in History with a focus on Russian Studies. Here's a tidbit not a lot of people know - I actually have a degree in History with a focus on Russian Studies. I also **love** being creative! One of my favorite things to do is to paint. When I was a kid I loved watching Bob Ross which really inspired me to just create without worry of mistakes.

I was working on the very last challenge on grasshopper intro to webpages and couldn't figure out why this wasn't working. Then I stopped and read through it and noticed I was missing a "t"! 

`...button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (button.textContent === 'Like') {
        button.textConent = 'Liked!';
        } else {
        button.textContent = 'Like';
        };
    });
}`
