###Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

First week was honestly nothing like I expected it would be. After years of traditional education style where you listen to material then try and attain high grades and memorize every little detail.

###What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

I'm excited to learn more about javascript. I find it extremely interesting and such a powerful tool. We've only touched on it just a few times within this first week but I'm excited none the less.
