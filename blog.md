### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

First week was honestly nothing like I expected it would be. After years of traditional education style where you listen to a guided lesson on material then try and achieve high grades and memorize every little detail especially with my history degree since it was all about memorization. The way the camp has gone this first week is almost a nice breather from that. You're on your own code learning path guided by both instructors and peers.  

### What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

I'm excited to learn more about javascript. I find it extremely interesting and such a powerful tool. We've only touched on it just a few times within this first week but I'm excited nonetheless.

### What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog? 

Here's a tidbit not a lot of people know - I actually have a degree in History with a focus on Russian Studies. I also **love** being creative! One of my favorite things to do is to paint. When I was a kid I loved watching Bob Ross which really inspired me to just create without worry of mistakes. I also love to hike the trials around Louisville as well as garden. My favorite season is summer!

I was working on the very last challenge on grasshopper intro to webpages and couldn't figure out why this wasn't working. Then I stopped and read through it and noticed I was missing a "t"! 

```javascript
...button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (button.textContent === 'Like') {
        button.textConent = 'Liked!';
        } else {
        button.textContent = 'Like';
        };
    });
}
```

# Blog Post Onboarding Spring 2

### What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?

I think they are the perfect trio. HTML to lay out your basic format, css to make it nice to look at and javascript to make it functional. This week really opened my eyes to the fact that you don't really need to write much html and it can all be done in JS. You can do a lot with just html and css but js really brings projects to life and provides users with a more fluid experience. 

### What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?

I never really thought about writing out logic for code before but pseudocoding is extremely useful in writing out code. I've always liked writing out problems before starting projects just to break it down into something easier for me to understand. One of my personal AHA moments this week is that pseudocoding isn't just a useful thing to do for javascript but the fact that it can be used to break down the logic of any problem and implement any code you'd like! 

### What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?

Demo days were extremely helpful for me being remote. I know it's something perviously done in person but being remote doesn't allow for much collaboration so being able to see what others have been working on and the challenges they faced was really helpful. 

### What hindered your progress during Onboarding?

I'm a hands on learner. There is just so much coming at you during Onboarding you feel overwhelmed. It feels like you're on an island with a stack of documents and told that somewhere in these pages is the secret to get off the island, good luck! Documentation isn't all bad when you know the end goal but it really felt like I was throwing uncooked spaghetti at a wall and expecting it to stick. It wasn't until I started sandboxing as I went through the documentation that things started to make since. So really it was just trying to learn my learning process that hindered me.  

### How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding? 

Anytime I would come across a challenge I tried to understand the root of it? I would start by asking myself questions. It always starts off with "Come on really?? Why isn't this working?" Well, what exactly am I trying to do? What does this function/method do? Lets just console.log everything! Sometimes it still doesn't work. That's when I have to tell myself to step away and come back later. And it's usually when I come back I can solve it as soon as I sit down.

### What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?

Bootstrap. I see the possibilities with it but ultimately I find it extremely cumbersome to use. I feel like it's extremely hard to organize your ideas with bootstrap and pin point small design changes you want to make. Plus the fact that you can write all the class styles in any which order you want on a line. WHY?? If I were to go back and look at that code after a week or month I feel like I would spend another month just trying to decipher it. Anyways, Bootstrap !== myFav. (week three and I'm already making programming jokes)  

### What is the one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?

Probably JS Data Structures, I feel like we've only scratched the surface of what JS can do. After that I was extremely interested in the idea of Atomic Design and found the way it was explained in class to be useful when breaking down webpages and seeing smaller components which made it easier to think about things. 

### What is your "Why"?

Since I was a kid I have always loved technology but was never given the opportunity to pursue it. I found myself working for an established startup in Louisville as a manufacturing tech. a few years back that allowed me to work closely with software engineers and I was amazed by what they were able to do. During covid all my bosses were laid off and the engineers left to work safely from their homes. I had to stay at the office to do my work and ended up working long days doing engineering work for manufacturers pay. I realized just how little freedom I had and felt like I could be doing more with my life. I wanted to code and do that amazing stuff the software engineers were doing. It was a nice dream at the time but I couldn't quit my job and put my family at risk. My husband was trying to pursue his own dreams of running a startup so money was tight. In March of 2022 the new owners of company showed up and fired over half of my coworkers and told the rest of us that we may or may not have a job after september. My husband said he would put his dreams on hold for mine and found a stable job to support us. So my why? I do it for him, I do it so I can spend more time my aging/sick parents, I do it to support my family, but I do it for me most of all because I want to prove I can do it, be successful at it, and have that freedom I've always dreamed of.
