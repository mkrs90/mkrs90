              My name is Katy Simpson. About a year ago I decided I wanted to do something completely different with my life, decided to quit career and start my Journey in learning code.
              I decided I wanted to take this journey to help better my life and the lives of those around me. This blog is here to showcase that journey through the awesome inc bootcamp and 
              hopefully into a fulfilling career in code. I love nature and hiking and saw many similarities in prepping for a hike and struggling through rough terrain and learning code so my blog
              makes many comparisons to that. So please join my on my journey here and lets pack some snacks and make tracks!
